Hi! My name is Salil Borkar. </n>
I'm a Software Engineer <i>denrut</i> Product Manager. <br/><br/>
I love technology and product management,  not necessarily in the same order ;-) <br/><br/>

I'm a travelohic, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/salilborkar/">an amateur photographer</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/salilborkar">a bibliophile</a> and <a href="https://betweenmillionthings.wordpress.com">an occassional writer</a>

</br>I listen to songs when I'm working, not working, traveling, reading and also while writing. Music makes me focus and channel my thoughts. <br/>
