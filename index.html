<p>Hi! My name is Salil Borkar </p>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer <i>turned</i> Product Manager</p>
<p>I love all things technology and the products created using technology, but not necessarily in the same order ;-)</p>
<p>I'm a travelholic, 
  an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/salilborkar/">amateur photographer</a>, 
  a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/salilborkar">bibliophile</a> and 
  an <a href="https://betweenmillionthings.wordpress.com">occassional writer</a><br/><br/>
</p>

<p>I'm usually listening to classical and rock while sometimes alternating to pop when I'm working, 
  <br/> not working, traveling, reading and also while writing. <br/> It usually keeps me sane in an otherwise insane back & fore grounds of life ;-) <br/>
