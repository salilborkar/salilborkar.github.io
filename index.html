Hi! My name is Salil Borkar <br/><br/>

I'm a Software Engineer <i>denrut</i> Product Manager <br/><br/>

I love technology and products created using technology, but not necessarily in the same order ;-) <br/><br/>

I'm a travelholic, an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/salilborkar/">amateur photographer</a>, a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/salilborkar">bibliophile</a> and an <a href="https://betweenmillionthings.wordpress.com">occassional writer</a><br/><br/>

I'm usually listening to classical and rock while sometimes alternating to pop when I'm working, not working, traveling, reading and also while writing. <br/> It usually keeps me sane in an otherwise insane back & fore grounds of life ;-) <br/>
